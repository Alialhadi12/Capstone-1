    <h2>the objective:</h2>
    <p>This page aims to show my learning and programming progress, this is the first capstone project. </p>
    <h2>What have I learned so far?</h2>
    <p>as if now, I've taken multiple python curses, so I'm not entirely new to programming. this page was created after a day of learning HTML.</p>
    <h2>How is the learning journey going?</h2>
    <p>I'd say it's going great, like learning anything for the first time, there is a lot of ups and downs, I mainly strugle with: 
        <ul>
            <li>Finishing a curse all the way through</li>
            <li>Not getting distracted</li>
            <li>Finding the time to learn more</li>
        </ul>
    And I'd say that my strengths are:
        <ul>
            <li>Being able learn and understand new subjects swiftly </li>
            <li>Balancing school, work and online learning</li>
            <li>Staying motivated and having a clear mind</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
